TODO

- Roster and info at the bottom of each WoW-Progress Guild Page is loaded via Javascript after the page loads
  so requests.get(url).context does not capture the data. We can either get this from other sources,
  or use something like dryscrape (python lib) to create a webkit session and scrape the javascript portions

- Retrieve all characters on self.server who are not in a guild and retrieve the same data for them as we do for
  characters in guilds (from above point)

- Use WCL API to grab recent ilvl parses for all characters we are interested in

- (Afterthought) Cronjob for going through WoWprogress LFG and alert when new person is LFG, filtering for our raid times

- Use a library, such as xlsxwriter, to create a Excel sheet(s) with all our data. 
  Make it easy to navigate, color code players based on class, link characters to guilds, etc
